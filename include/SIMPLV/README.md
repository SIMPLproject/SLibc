# SIMPLV â€“ A Seamless SIMD Vector Library

```SIMPLV``` is a SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) vector library, part of the ```SIMPL_libc```, that simplifies the complexities of cross-architecture SIMD programming. With SIMPLV, you can write highly optimized vectorized code that works effortlessly across multiple CPU architectures, including ARM, x86, and x86-64.

## Key Features
**Architecture-Aware Optimization:** Automatically adapts to the hardware, allowing transitions between SIMD instruction sets such as AVX, SSE, and NEON with no extra effort.

**Register Scaling:** Automatically scales 128-bit registers to 256-bit where possible, ensuring maximum utilization of your hardware's potential.

**Unified API:** A simple and intuitive API that abstracts away the low-level differences between SIMD architectures, letting you focus on coding, not hardware.


## Installation
To include SIMPLV in your project, simply clone the repository and add it to your build system:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/bonsthie/simplv.git
```

Ensure that the necessary flags for your compiler are enabled to support AVX, SSE, or NEON, depending on the target architecture.

# Usage
The library provides a straightforward API for SIMD operations. Here's an example of how you can add two vectors of integers using SIMPLV:

```c
#include <simplv.h>

{
  vec v1 = v256b_load_char('a');
  vec v2 = v256b_load_char('b');

  vec result = v32c_add(v1, v2);
}
```

Where `vec` is a vector type, `v256b_load_char()` loads characters into 256-bit registers, and `v32c_add()` performs vector addition for character types. **SIMPLV** automatically optimizes the operation based on the underlying hardware.

Supported Architectures
**ARM** (NEON instructions)
**x86/x86-64** (SSE, AVX)
