/*
	* explanation:
* MOVSB copies a byte from the memory location pointed by the DS:SI registers to the memory location pointed by the ES:DI registers.
* REP repeats the MOVSB instruction CX times.
* The function uses the REP STOSB instruction to set the memory pointed by b to the value c.
* The function uses the Enhanced REP MOVSB/STOSB feature if it is supported by the CPU.
* The function uses the regular memset function if the Enhanced REP MOVSB/STOSB feature is not supported by the CPU.
* The function returns the pointer to the memory block.
